# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
This project aims in Credit Card Fraud Detection using Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classification Models from scikit-learn. 
The data is taken from the dataset creditcard.csv from Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud.  
The dataset is loaded and preprocessed before training the models. A sample data is created to train the model in order to get proper predictions. At last the accuracy scores of bothe models are compared.
To run the project, open the Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection.ipynb file.
